# TODO list

## Verilator support

* [ ] Use command arguments to configure port and timeout (amongst other)
* [ ] Add tracing
* [ ] Support get and set commands for individual array items management
* [ ] How to access public signals without adding /*verilator_public*/ statements everywhere?
* [ ] Implement a proper C++ wrapper for CJSON to simplify usage (e.g. error management + freeing memory)
