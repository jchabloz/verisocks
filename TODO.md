## Verilator support

* [ ] How to cope with callbacks on signals?
* [ ] How to access public signals without adding /*verilator_public*/
  statements everywhere?
* [ ] Should we use VPI (partial) support provided by Verilator or implement
  alternatives?
* [ ] Implement a proper C++ wrapper for CJSON to simplify usage (e.g. error
  management + freeing memory)
