You are reading the documentation for **Verisocks** |version|, a generic TCP
socket server interface over VPI, originally intended to be used as an
interface for the `Icarus verilog simulator
<https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/#>`_.
From the version 1.3, an integration of Verisocks to be used with C++ code
generated by `Verilator <https://verilator.org>`_ is also provided.

Features
========

* **Easy to integrate** within any existing verilog testbench (only :ref:`one
  system task <sec_verisocks_init>` to be called within the top-level
  ``initial`` statement)
* As an alternative, Verisocks also supports a simple API to use with Verilated
  C++ code.
* Verisocks interfaces with the simulator simply via a standard **TCP socket**
  with a :ref:`JSON-based protocol <sec_tcp_protocol>`
* Using this interface, Verisocks allows to **control the simulation** and
  probe its status by:

  * instructing the simulator to run for a given amount of time,
  * instructing the simulator to run until a given simulation time,
  * instructing to run the simulator until a certain event,
  * reading or writing simulator variables,
  * getting the current simulation time,
  * etc...
