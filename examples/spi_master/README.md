# Verisocks example - SPI master

## Introduction

This example shows how to use Verisocks with a simple SPI master model to drive
a full-duplex SPI bus with arbitrary content as well as read the result sent by
an SPI slave on the same bus. For the purpose of the example, a simplistic SPI
slave sends back the same content that was sent by the master in the previous
transaction.

## Trigger an SPI transaction from Python

The main point of the example is to demonstrate how to use Verisocks to drive
an SPI transaction. You will see that this is actually extremely easy. The used principle requires the following components:

1. A verilog task
2. A verilog named event
3. A verilog `always` statement triggering the task at the named event
4. Python code setting verilog state variables and triggering the task

In the SPI master model, we have the following task to trigger a transaction:

```verilog
task spi_transmit_buffer
//...
endtask
```

The following ยง is also created:

```verilog
event start_transaction;
```

We make sure that every time that the ยง is triggered, the task is executed:

```verilog
always @(start_transaction) spi_transmit_buffer(8'd0);
```

And finally, we use the following Python code to define the content of the SPI
TX buffer, trigger the named event `start_transaction`, run the simulation
until the transaction has finished and read the content of the RX buffer.

```python
def send_spi(vs, tx_buffer):
    vs.set("spi_master_tb.i_spi_master.tx_buffer",
           value=tx_buffer)
    answer = vs.get("value",
                    path="spi_master_tb.i_spi_master.transaction_counter")
    counter = answer['value']
    vs.set("spi_master_tb.i_spi_master.start_transaction")
    vs.run("until_change",
           path="spi_master_tb.i_spi_master.end_transaction")
    answer = vs.get("value",
                    path="spi_master_tb.i_spi_master.rx_buffer")
    rx_buffer = answer['value']
    return rx_buffer, counter
```
